**Part 1:**
For inspiration, I found an interesting example on [Happycoding,randomwalker](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/animation/random-walker),which used for loop to created a random oil painting like animation![The inspiration project](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/animation/images/random-walker-1.png). I am planning to use this tecnique to my group project since I believe this tecnique would be beneficial because it has a geometric patterns which may represent the theme of the art work we will pick for the group work, for instence,"Claude Monet'Saint Georges majeur au creÃÅpuscule'".
